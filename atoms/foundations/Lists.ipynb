    "In this lesson we're going to explore two, more advanced *data types*. In previous weeks we looked at numeric (*integers* and *floats*) and textual (*strings*) data, but it's probably been quite difficult to imagine how you'd assemble these simple data into something useful. The new data types (lists and dictionaries) will _begin_ to show you how that can happen, and they will allow you to 'express' much more complex concepts with ease.\n",

    "In other words, we've got: `myNumber = 5` or `myString = \"Hello world!\"`. And that's it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, with **lists** and **dictionaries** we can store _multiple_ things: several numbers, several strings, or some mish-mash of both. This is much as you would with a _real_ dictionary (which holds the definitions of lots of words) or a _real_ list (which holds the things that you need to get done today).\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the simple explanations in parentheses above encompass the main difference between lists and dictionaries:\n",
    "- A _list_ is an *ordered* collection of 'items' (numbers, strings, etc.). You can ask for the first item in a list, the 3rd, or the 1,000th, it doesn't really matter because your list has an order and it keeps that order.\n",
    "- A _dictionary_ is an *unordered* collection of 'items' (numbers, strings, etc.). You access items in a dictionary in a similar way to how you access a real dictionary: you have a 'key' (i.e. the word for which you want the definition) and you use this to look up the 'value' (i.e. the definition of the word).\n",
    "\n",
    "There's obviously a lot more to lists and dictionaries than this, but it's a good starting point: lists = ordered, dictionaries = unordered. Or, if you're starting to think in Python, perhaps we should write that: `lists==unordered` and `dictionaries==unordered`.\n",
    "\n",

    "`append()` is a function, and there are many other functions that can be applied to lists such as: `range`, `len`, `insert` and `index`. You tell Python to *execute a function* (sometimes also termed *calling a function*) by writing the function's name, followed by a set of parentheses. The parentheses will contain any optional inputs necessary for the function to do its job. Appending to a list wouldn't be very useful if you couldn't tell Python _what_ to append in the first place!\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions `range` and `len` are also good examples of this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "len(theParty)\n",
    "range(theParty)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, the function `len` (lazy short-hand for _length_) is _passed_ `theParty` list as an input in order to do its magic. And `range` works the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions `append`, `insert` and `index` work a _little_ bit differently. They have to be _called_ using `theParty` list. We're at risk of joining Alice down the rabbit-hole here, so let's just leave it at: the second set of functions are of a particular _type_ known as *methods* of the *list class*. We'll stop there. \n",

    "<img src=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/files/2013/01/alice-falling-down-rabbit-hole1.jpg\" width=\"250\" />\n",

    "In order to use a _list method_ you always need to 'prepend' (i.e. lead with) the name of list you want to work with, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "theParty.append(\"New Guest\")\n",
    "theParty.insert(2, \"Anastasia\")\n",
    "theParty.index(\"Sarah\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea here is that methods are associated with specific types of things such as lists, whereas generic functions are kind of free-floating. Think about it this way: you can't append something to a number, because that _makes no sense_. Appending is something that only makes sense in the context of a list. In contrast, something like `len` works on several different types of variables: lists and string both!"
