At the limit, people have claimed that if a computer can pass the Turing Test then we'll have to declare that machines have become full AIs (Artificial Intelligences). To put it another way: if it sounds like a human and responds like a human... then it's a human?\n",

Here, computers can do billions -- or trillions -- of calculations a second to work out that if 'A' happens then 'B' is the next most likely thing to happen, and so on and so on.\n",

    "The difference is that games like Go and Chess have well-understood rules, as do processes like climate change and (sort of) earthquakes. Chess is 'easier' for a computer than Go because a big enough computer can work out every possible chess move and pick the best one whereas it can't do that for Go and so has to make programmed 'choices' based on incomplete information. Earthquakes have even more 'rules', but they still (as far as know) follow _some_ set of fixed rules dictated by physics and chemistry. \n",

    "People, however, don't use the same unchanging rules in conversation. Yes, conversations have norms, unless you're using an online comment forum where it's normal to start a conversation by asking someone if they're an idiot, but people don't just 'play games' within the rules, they actually play with the rules themselves in a way that computers find very, very hard to follow.

    "### The 3 virtues of a programmer\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful idea comes from [Larry Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall) (the man with the strong 'tache game below!), who created a programming language called Perl. Larry said that programmers had three virtues: Laziness, Hubris, and Impatience. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://cdn.quotationof.com/images/larry-wall-1.jpg\",width=\"250\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the reasons that these are virtues in programming (but not in your studies!) are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Laziness** makes you want to put in the effort _now_ to reduce the amount of effort you'll have to put in _later_. So the effort that went into inventing the calculator in the first place (and in making it easy to use) meant that lots and lots of other people never had to do this stuff by hand or using slide rules.\n",
    "2. **Hubris** makes you want to write code that other people won't want to \"say bad things about\". In the course we'll get into what makes 'good' code in more detail, but the short version is: it's efficient, it's easy to read, and it's clever.\n",
    "3. **Impatience** is about wanting the answer _now_ and looking for ways to get there as quickly as possible. If you find yourself writing a lot of code to do _basic_ things from scratch, or waiting long periods of time for something that the computer should be able to do _quickly_ then you should be impatient. Chances are, you made a mistake in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Hint: you'll also see a lot of laziness when you start trying to write code. Programmers don't like writing `remove` when they could just write `rm`, nor do they like writing `define` when they could just write `def`. Keep an eye out for these mnemonics as they can be pretty daunting at first._**"

    "### The 3 false virtues\n",
    "\n",
    "Larry also pointed out that these virtues had three mirror-image false virtues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **False laziness** happens when you leave something working but half-finished and, most likely, about to break. When you start using [StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com/) you may find that it makes it easy to copy+paste answers into your notebook and then you can glue it together messily. This isn't the same as _understanding_ and _adapting_ the solution that you found online to _your_ problem, so it's false laziness. To really develop a learning mindset, [don't copy+paste code, type it out](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-benefits-of-typing-instead-of-copying-54ed734ad849#.es5mw1j0z). \n",
    "2. **False hubris** is thinking that no one else's code is 'good enough' for you. Sometimes copy+paste is false laziness, but refusing to recognise when copy+paste (or importing a library, more on this later) _is_ the right thing to do is false hubris.\n",
    "3. **False impatience** is getting started on coding your answer to a problem when you don't yet understand what the problem actually _is_. One thing that a lot of programmers do is half-listen to what someone has asked them to do and then go haring off without sitting down to make any kind of plan. It's like writing an essay without having done the readings. Nudge, nudge.\n",

    "## The Benefits of Coding?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a research context we think that the benefits of learning to code fall into three categories:\n",
    "1. **Flexibility**: a computer can often apply the _same_ analytical process to a completely different data set (_e.g._ rainfall in UK vs rainfall in the US) with minimal effort compared to trying to do each step manually in, say, Excel or SPSS. For students it comes down to this: if you discover a newer, better data set half way through your dissertation and want to use this for your analysis instead of the old, inaccurate data, it's a lot easier and faster to update your analyses if you have used code to do the analysis to-date!\n",
    "2. **Reproducibility**: recently, it's been discovered that a lot of research cannot be reproduced. In other words, if one scientist tries to duplicate what someone else did in order to check something out (as is important in the scientific method) they're finding that the results don't line up. So a second example of why coding your data analysis for a dissertation: you've just finished your analysis when someone points out that you made a mistake with the data right back at the beginning; redoing all of that in Excel or SPSS would be a nightmare, but with code it can be as easy as changing one line and hitting 'Run'!\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: a computer doesn't care if you throw 10 lines or 10 billion lines at it, the only thing that changes is how long it takes to get an answer. In other words, if your code 'works' on a subset of your data it should also work on your entire data set no matter how big it is. This is also a good way to develop code: rather than try to read in the whole data set in one go while you're still trying to understand it, take a few rows and make sure you're handling _those_ ones correctly (and if what you see squares with what you were told) before expanding to larger and larger subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the payoff for coding the answer to a problem instead of just clicking through the options in SPSS or Arc can seem a long way away. Again, it's like learning a new language: you spend a lot of time asking directions to the train station or whether someone had a nice breakfast before you can start work on the novel or the business case. But the payoff _is_ there if you stick with it!"

    "There's no reason you'd know it yet, but the web page you're looking at is also known as a 'notebook' -- it's why you can 'run' code as part of the web page. Check out this example by clicking in the box (next to the <span style=\"color:blue;font-family:monospace\">In [ ]</span>) and hitting the 'run' button or typing Ctrl+Return at the same time."

    "The reason we mention this is that _all_ these notebooks were designed with _**geography students**_ in mind. Rather than throw you in at the deep end with examples taken from computer science classes, we've tried to give you _geographical_ examples whenever possible in the hopes that the early examples will seem a _little_ less abstract and a _little_ more relevant to _your_ needs. Of course, the early examples are also very basic so the payoff might not be obvious right away, but trust us: if you stick with it you will start to chagne your thinking about geography as a discipline and about the power of computers to transform _everything_."

    "### Python vs R\n",
    "\n",
    "Alongside Python, the other language that is often mentioned by people doing data-led research is [R](https://www.r-project.org). It's the _other_ one that many of your lecturers and a lot of other scientists use in a lot of their work.  There's [a great deal of debate about the relative merits of Python and R](https://www.quora.com/Which-is-better-for-data-analysis-R-or-Python), but for our purposes _both_ Python and R can help us to undertake geographical analysis. That is, in fact, the premise of this entire course! \n",
    "\n",
    "So why have we chosen to use Python here? Of the two languages, we think that Python has some specific advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It was designed for teaching, so its syntax is easier for a human to 'parse' than R's\n",
    "2. It is more _like_ other languages, so its more readily transferrable if you need to learn another language. Think of it as learning Italian, which also makes it easier to learn Spanish and French.\n",
    "3. It is the one most-used as part of a _geographical workflow_ â€“ what we mean by this is that you can find Python buried inside of ESRI's ArcGIS and the open-source QGIS applications, and it also sits behind (or talks to) a number of other tools that allow us to work flexibly and scalably with geo-data. \n",
    "4. Is is easier to operationalise â€“Â Python offers more services/tools to enable you to turn something from a 'hack' ([which doesn't mean what you think it means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacks_at_the_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology) into a 'service'.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you have been told R is the way to go then don't worry, the concepts covered here still translate. And many of the contributors to to these notebooks use both languages... it just depends on the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, we are using Python version 2.7. You can also download a version 3 of Python -- we're sticking with the older version for the time being because there are more (geo) tools available to us in Python 2 than Python 3 but we _will_ be changing soon. So, for now, if at any point you are asked to choose between Python versions, make sure you pick 2.X (there will be a 2.8 and 2.9 eventually)."
