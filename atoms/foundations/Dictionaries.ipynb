    ">[GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html) is an open and popular geographic data format commonly used in web applications. It is an extension of a format called [JSON](http://json.org), which stands for *JavaScript Object Notation*. Basically, JSON is a table turned on its side. GeoJSON extends JSON by adding a section called \"geometry\" such that you can define coordinates for the particular object (point, line, polygon, multi-polygon, etc). A point in a GeoJSON file might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"type\": \"Feature\",\n",
    "      \"geometry\": {\n",
    "        \"type\": \"Point\",\n",
    "        \"coordinates\": [\n",
    "          -122.65335738658904,\n",
    "          45.512083676585156\n",
    "        ]\n",
    "      },\n",
    "      \"properties\": {\n",
    "        \"name\": \"Hungry Heart Cupcakes\",\n",
    "        \"address\": \"1212 SE Hawthorne Boulevard\",\n",
    "        \"website\": \"http://www.hungryheartcupcakes.com\",\n",
    "        \"gluten free\": \"no\"\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    ">GeoJSON files have to have both a `\"geometry\"` section and a `\"properties\"` section. The `\"geometry\"` section houses the geographic information of the feature (its location and type) and the `\"properties\"` section houses all of the descriptive information about the feature (like fields in an attribute table).
