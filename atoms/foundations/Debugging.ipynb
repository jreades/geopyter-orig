    "This lesson is all about learning to deal with the (unavoidable) errors that you will encounter when programming in Python. Most programmers spend _most_ of their day dealing with errors of one sort or another: sometimes they are easy to solve (e.g. you mis-typed a variable name), other times they are very, very hard (e.g. you are writing a cloud computing platform and have to deal with competition for resources). Either way, learning how to find, diagnose, and resolve errors, as well as how to minimize their consequences, is a crucial skill for programmers. \n",

    "## Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "A Syntax Error is likely to the be the most frequent that error you encounter when you're getting started. Syntax errors occur when the Python interpreter has trouble *[parsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing)* your code. In other words, it can read what you've typed, but it doesn't quite make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a bit like when someone who doesn't speak your language fluently makes a mistake that to you seems funny, but to them is quite natural because they're extrapolating from what they know in a different language. Many English-speakers who are 'embarassed' by their level of Spanish are apparently quite happy to inform Spanish-speakers that they are pregnant ('embarazada')! Or perhaps you think that the opposite of 'regardless' is 'irregardless'? These are natural mistakes, but they are 'errors' nonetheless. It's just that human beings – being smart – can figure out what you meant, while computers – being almost irredeemably stupid – cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A simple typo\n",
    "In the first example for instance, the error consists in a misspelled `print` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "File \"<ipython-input-6-9bf4eef14fd8>\", line 1\n",
    "    prnt( \"Ouch!\" )\n",
    "               ^\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's read the error message together, from top-to-bottom: \n",
    "\n",
    "- First, the interpreter prints out the file name and the line number where it thinks the error can be found. In our simple case that's not a big deal since we only have two lines of code in that block anyway, but if you had thousands of lines of code spread across dozens of separate files this could be a life-saver!\n",
    "- In addition, Python also prints the _actual_ place on the line where it threw up its hands and said \"I can't read this!\" \n",
    "- It has even added a little 'caret' ( ‸ ) to try to point out where on that line it _thinks_ the error really is. We wouldn't recommend that you study _only_ that bit of code (it pointed to 'Ouch!' after all, not to `prnt`) but it's not a bad place to start...\n",
    "- Lastly, Python prints out very clearly that the error is something to do with the syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're trying to track down a bug, it really can't get better than this. It's not _perfect_ because it points at part of the line that is technically 'ok', but that's because this is the point at which the Python interpreter realises it has no idea what's going on. But as long you don't focus on the idea that it's the excalamation mark that is the problem and look at the _context_ then it shouldn't take too long to figure it out. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make it even easier, notice that when you change `prnt` to <span style=\"color:green;font-weight:bold;font-family:monospace\">print</span> it changes the colour and weight of the text as well to highlight that it now knows what you mean.\n",

Can you check the network connection?\" So in Python, one part of the application can  'throw' an exception (\"Hey, I'm not online\") when it tries to download a file and then it's up to the application to _catch_ that problem and print a warning to the user.\n",

    "## What To Do When Things Go Wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a \"rule of thumb\" list of actions to take when Python throws an error at you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Don't Panic!*\n",
    "- Take a deep breath and read the error message *CAREFULLY*.\n",
    "- Ask yourself: is it a *Syntax Error* or an *Exception*?\n",
    "  - In both cases: what clues are there to where Python thinks the problem lies?\n",
    "  - For *Syntax Errors*: what's the little caret character ( ‸ ) pointing at?\n",
    "  - For *Exceptions*: what kind of exception is it? Read the [Official Docs](https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html) and try to make sense of it\n",
    "- *No, really. Don't Panic!*\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, and we can't say this enough: sometimes fixing _one_ error reveals _another_ one. You need to pay lots of attention here because if you are just waiting for your code to output the correct answer and aren't noticing that the error **_has changed_** then you might think that you're no closer to finding the answer when, in fact, you've just taken a big step forward. So you might fix a syntax error only to discover an exception lurking underneath and the _main_ clue is a change in the error text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fixing Code in Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The other thing that many experienced programmers learn to do is to develop the code in _steps_: just as you are unlikely to sit down and write the next great American novel in one go, you're unlikely to be able to sit down and write a full computational geography analysis in one go! The _best_ way to tackle this problem -- and the best way to tackle a bug -- is to break it down into smaller pieces and solve those pieces one bit at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try a simple example: imagine that you want to produce 100 maps, two for each American state, showing the location of the state capital on one, and the location of all of the other cities on the other. You don't try to write all of this in one go; here's how an experienced programmer solves it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can I produce any kind of map of one state?\n",
    "2. Can I produce a map of one state showing the state capital?\n",
    "3. Can I produce a map of one state showing _not_ the state capital?\n",
    "4. Can I produce the same pair of maps for two states?\n",
    "5. Can I produce the same pair of maps for every state?\n",
    "\n",
    "We build from the simplest thing -- producing a map -- to the most complex thing -- producing maps for each and every state in small steps. And the way I've written \\#2 and \\#3 is deliberate because it's also a very computational way of thinking: if you can solve the problem of how to show the state capital on a map then you have very likely _also_ solved the problem of showing every city _except_ the state capital on a map (this connects to ideas of sets and loops which we'll cover in other sections).
