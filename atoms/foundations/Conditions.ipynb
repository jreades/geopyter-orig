    "By themselves, variables and `print()` statements aren't very useful -- without what we learn in this session, using Python might seem like using a particularly stupid version of Word! But when we add the concept of a _comparison_ we add the possibility of allowing the computer to make 'choices' depending on the outcome of that comparison: is item A bigger than item B? Is the population of this city more than 2.5 million, or less than 2.5 million? \n",

That's an _outcome_ based on a comparison and it moves us away from thinking about making choices about how to show each city on a map individually, and towards defining a set of _rules_ for how to show any city on a map: we have _generalised_ the problem!"

For example, find all the possible areas for a wind farm that are: 1) on a hill that is less that 17 degrees in steepness; 2) at least 250m from a river; 3) West-facing so that they get the most wind... That is the _same_ problem as the one above and we could write it as `X AND Y AND Z`.\n",
